## Mindset

<br/><br/>
The main thing I try to adhear to is to conserve to power and flexibility of vanilla languages, while empowering each languange with modularization. I figured that this would give us best of both worlds. After all, everything is written in vanilla code, so all problems should be solvable from there. With this in mind I try to avoid one-off packages unless they provide us with a solution to a specific problem of a high complexity such as react-table.

## Stack

<br/><br/>

- React
- Storybook (Standalone UI Library Composition)
- Cypress (E2E testing)
- Emotion (CSS inheritance and modularization)
- react-table (Headless table)

<br/><br/><br/>

## Getting started

<br/><br/>

###### Step 1

`npm install`

###### Step 2

`npm start`

## Storybook - The UI Library

<br/><br/>

Storybook was added to modularize UI components and organize a UI Library.
This encourages us to build standalone UI components that should operate with mock data alone, as well as document use cases for each component.
Launch storybook with `npm run storybook`.
