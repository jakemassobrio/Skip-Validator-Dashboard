# Basic Concept

The main thing I try to adhear to is to conserve to power and flexibility of vanilla languages, while empowering each languange with modularization. I figured that this would give us best of both worlds. After all, everything is written in vanilla code, so all problems should be solvable from there. With this in mind I try to avoid one-off packages unless they provide us with a solution to a specific problem of a high complexity such as react-table.

The main stack is:

React
Storybook (Standalone UI Library Composition)
Cypress (E2E testing)
Emotion (for CSS inheritance and modularization)
react-table
